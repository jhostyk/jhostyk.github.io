<p>Sefer Similarity Map is an exploratory tool to help uncover the substructure of books/chapters of Tanach, Talmud, and other Jewish texts, and visualize the underlying relationships between them.<br>
These relationships can illuminate historical, authorial, linguistic, and stylistic connections between texts. The tool can also pick out related texts to any that one is currently learning or teaching.<br></p>
